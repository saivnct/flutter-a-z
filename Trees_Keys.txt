3 type of trees:
    - Widget tree
        - Combination of widgets in your code
        - build() is called very frequently to check for required updates
    - Element tree
        - In-memory representation of your widgets
        - Flutter take Widget tree -> translate into Element tree
        - Used for determining necessary UI updates
        - Elements are re-used if possible, they're not re-created all the time. 
            - Elements're created initially when a widget's build() called for 1st time
            - For subsequent caused of widget's build() called , elements are instead reused
            - Element tree will determine which UI should be rerendered
    - Render tree
        - The visible UI buiding blocks
        - Updated when determined via Element tree comparisons
        - Only (partially) re-rendered if UI updates are needed



Keys: using key(identification criteria) allow flutter to match Elements to Widgets, make sure every Widget has exactly the Element with exactly the State it needs
    - ValueKey() - any kind of value can be key (number, string ...)
    - ObjectKey() - object as a key
