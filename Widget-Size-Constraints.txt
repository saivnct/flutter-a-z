Widget Size Constraints:
- Widgets get sized based on their size 'preferences' & parent widget 'size constraints'


1. Scaffold:
	- Constraints:
		- height: max device height
		- width: max device width

2. Column:
	- Preferences:
		- height: as much as possible (INFINITY)	=> must inside a parent that restricts the height, otherwise it would go outside of the screen boundaries
		- width: as much as needed by children


3. Row:
	- Preferences:
		- height: as much as needed by children
		- width: as much as possible (INFINITY)
